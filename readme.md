# ASL Offline Practice

## Why Another ASL App?
I wanted a tool to use:
+ **offline** _(eg: in a subway)_
+ on my **phone** _(ie "mobile first")_
+ _and_ on my **desktop**

This started with finger-spelling only, but is in the process of evolving to do more.

## What Is It?
Flashcard style webapp to help me learn American Sign Language (ASL), for fun.
I'm currently a beginner.

## Feature Complete?
Currently only handles finger-spelling, but working on ability to any new sign. See [issues](../../issues) for more.
