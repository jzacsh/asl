# ASL Offline Practice

## Why Did Another One?
Wanted an that I could use: *offline*, on my *phone*, and on my *desktop*. This
started with finger spelling only, but has since evolved.

## What Is It?
Flashcard style webapp to help me learn American Sign Language (ASL), for fun.
I'm currently a beginner.

## Feature Complete?
Currently only handles finger-spelling, but working on ability to any new sign.

### TODOs In Order of Priority
Specifically, I'm slowly working on the following:
+ Fill in e2e test to cover current fingerspelling only functionality
+ Storing settings per-device _(eg: speed, or even progress/history)_
+ Update config to either: preferrable jshintrc, or jscompiler instead
+ Storing new signs _(ie maybe "new signs" feature should only be for
  personal progress)_
+ Input of new signs _(via webcam-to-autoGIF functionality)_
