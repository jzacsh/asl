# ASL Offline Practice

## Why Did Another One?
Wanted an that I could use: *offline*, on my *phone*, and on my *desktop*. This
started with finger spelling only, but has since evolved.

## What Is It?
Flashcard style webapp to help me learn American Sign Language (ASL), for fun.
I'm currently a beginner.

## Feature Complete?
Currently it only handles finger-spelling. I'm slowly working on the following:
+ Input of new signs (via webcam-to-autoGIF functionality)
+ Storing settings per-device (eg: speed, or even progress/history)
+ Storing new signs (ie maybe first feature mentioned above should only be for
  personal progress)

## TODOs In Order of Priority
+ Fill in e2e test to cover current fingerspelling only functionality
+ Update config to either: preferrable jshintrc, or jscompiler instead
